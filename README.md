> *We covered a lot of ground in this tutorial, and we’ll be coming back to a lot of it in the very next project – working with UIKit isn’t a “nice to have” for most apps, so it’s best you get used to it and start building up your library of functionality wrappers.</br> And there’s Core Image. This is another one Apple’s extremely powerful frameworks that never quite made the smooth leap to Swift – you need to know it’s quirks if you want to make the most of it. Still, you’re through the worst of it now, so hopefully you can try using it in your own code!*

## &nbsp; 🎖 Challenge
* [x] Try making the Save button disabled if there is no image in the image view.

* [x] Experiment with having more than one slider, to control each of the input keys you care about. For example, you might have one for radius and one for intensity.

* [x] Explore the range of available Core Image filters, and add any three of your choosing to the app.
